# G14Crypto
A collection of scripts to capture random data and use it for various cryptographic purposes.
While the scripts use /dev/random as a randomness source for example purposes, it can be substituted with a (preferably) hardware true random number generator or source file (such as debiased atmospheric noise). The discussion of the quality of various "/dev/xyz" sources is beyond the scope of this document.
